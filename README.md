Archethic Public Blockchain aims to fulfill the fundamental need of giving everyone back the control over technology. It is a promise of safer, more inclusive, and truly decentralized world. 4 years of research and 11 strong international patents endow Archethic with the technological attributes that its predecessors have lacked - scalability, speed, reliability and the simplicity of a native biometric recognition. Designed for mass adoption, Archethic relies on a new form of ultra-secure validation consensus (ARCH), that allows unlimited number of transactions.

Network Funding (38.2%): Used by the foundation to fund the network development. It includes the circulating supply of 216M, remaining will be used to fund the future blockchain development.

Adoption Rewards (23.6%): Under the control of the DAO, this wallet is dedicated to promote the use of the Archethic Public Blockchain (incentives for core & dapps
developers, grants for new services and rewards for end users by using services).

Team & Advisors (14.5%): 2 years cliff from TGE with 60 months linear release with holding incentives & 3 years Cliff from TGE + 60 Months linear release 

Stacking Rewards (9%): 9M UCO per year distributed amongst people staking.

Exchange Liquidity (5.57%) : CEX & DEX Liquidity 

Dynamic Miners Reward (3.34%): Supplements the transaction fees to pay fixed miner incentives until transactions fees > miners rewards. This pool helps the network through bootstrap phase leading to equilibrium and deflation.

Gamification & Geo Incentives (3.44%): Used to reward nodes in the parts of the world that are not on the network and also reward the network participants for
being hooked-on the network. Gamification would be at the heart of achieving both the objectives.
